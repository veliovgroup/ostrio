Change Primary Email Address
======

 - [Direct link to Contacts panel](https://ostr.io/account/contacts)

"Primary Email" is the email address used to login and manages your account. To change "Primary Email" address you need to have at least one more verified email address in the [contacts panel](https://ostr.io/account/contacts).

Once another email address is added and verified, click on the *star* icon next to it. After you confirm this action you will be logged out, and since then you have to use new "Primary Email" to login into your account.
