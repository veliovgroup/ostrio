# Change Primary Email Address

- [Direct link to Contacts panel](https://ostr.io/account/contacts)

"Primary Email" is the email you are using to login into account. To change "Primary Email" address you need to have at least one more verified email address in the [contacts panel](https://ostr.io/account/contacts).

Once another email address is added and verified, click on the *star* icon next to it. After you confirm this action you will be logged out, and since then you have to use new "Primary Email" to login into your account.
