# Change Password

- [Direct link to password change](https://ostr.io/account/pwd)

Whenever you decide to change your current password, for example right after registration process where the system generates default password for your account, go to ["Change Password" panel](https://ostr.io/account/pwd) ("My Account" -> "Change Password"), enter your current (*old*) password, new password, and prompt new password once again.
