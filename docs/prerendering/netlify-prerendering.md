# Netlify Integration: Pre-rendering with ostr.io

This guide explains how to enable [ostr.io pre-rendering](https://ostr.io/info/prerendering) for sites deployed on Netlify.

## Overview

ostr.io pre-rendering delivers fully rendered HTML to search engines and modern AI crawlers, improving index coverage and discoverability while reducing origin load. The Netlify integration routes crawler traffic through ostr.io pre-rendering engine.

## Availability

* **Plans:** Available to **PRO** and **ENTERPRISE** Netlify subscriptions
* **Enablement:** Netlify must enable the integration for a site/account after receiving request with **Auth Token** (that begins with `Basic ...`)
* **SLA:** Netlify support team typically fulfills requests **within 24 hours**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security note:** Treat the Auth Token as a secret. Do not share it publicly or commit it to source control.


## Prerequisites

1. An active ostr.io account
2. An active Netlify account on **PRO** or **ENTERPRISE** plans
3. A site deployed on Netlify
4. An ostr.io **Pre-rendering Auth Header/Token** issued for specific host (string that starts with `Basic ...`).


## Enablement Steps (via Netlify Support)

1. **Prepare the Auth Token**

   * Ensure the value starts with `Basic ...` (for example: `Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6c2VjcmV0`).

2. **Open a ticket with Netlify Support**

   * Subject: “Enable ostr.io pre-rendering integration”
   * Include:

     * Site domain name or site IDs on Netlify
     * The **exact** ostr.io Auth Token (the full `Basic ...` string)
     * Confirmation that ostr.io pre-rendering should be enabled for crawler traffic

3. **Wait for confirmation**

   * Netlify enables the integration and replies in the ticket/email (typically within **24 hours**).

### Example — Message to Netlify Support

```text
Subject: Enable ostr.io pre-rendering integration

Hello Netlify Support,

Please enable the ostr.io pre-rendering integration for the following Netlify site:
- Site: example-site.netlify.app (Production domain: example.com)

X-Prerender-Token: Basic xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

This integration should route crawler traffic through ostrio's pre-rendering engine.

Thank you.
```


## Verifying the Integration

After Netlify confirms enablement: **Test with a crawler User-Agent** to confirm a fully rendered HTML response is served without requiring client-side JavaScript. Example checks:

```bash
# Simulate Googlebot; Should include X-Prerender-Id header
curl --head -A "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)" "https://example.com/"

# Simulate a standard browser (should receive standard response without X-Prerender-Id header)
curl --head -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://www.example.com/"
```

Expected result: the response includes `X-Prerender-Id` header with server-rendered content (meta tags, structured data, critical content in source). The standard browser request remains unchanged.

> [!TIP]
> Try different tools and real crawler fetch tools (e.g., Search Console’s URL inspection). Include "escaped fragment" query at the end in tools like "page speed", for example: `https://example.com/?_escaped_fragment_=/`


## Common Issues & Fixes

* **Invalid or missing Auth Token**

  * Symptoms: crawler requests not pre-rendered or return 401/403 errors.
  * Action: generate/verify the ostr.io token and re-submit the token to Netlify Support.

* **Error: wrong domain; check auth creds**
  
  * Reason: Provided token belongs to other domain name or has a typo
  * Action: Double-check of provided Token has typos; If you have multiple domain names added to ostr.io — Ensure provided Auth/X-Prerender-Token belongs to the correct website

* **Error: domain mismatch; check auth creds**

  * Reason: Provided token belongs to TLD, but used for subdomain
  * Action: Upgrade ostr.io account to PRO or BUSINESS plans to support subdomains pre-rendering; Or add subdomain as separate pre-rendering entity

* **Site not present/verified in ostr.io**

  * Symptoms: requests rejected by the pre-rendering layer.
  * Action: add and verify the production domain in ostr.io before testing.

* **Plan limitation**

  * Symptoms: integration requests declined or integration inactive in Netlify.
  * Action: upgrade Netlify account to **PRO** or **ENTERPRISE** plans.

* **Caching delay**

  * Symptoms: inconsistent behavior immediately after enablement.
  * Action: wait for edge propagation, redeploy the site, or purge caches.

* **IP allowlists / firewall**

  * Symptoms: blocked crawler traffic through the pre-rendering layer.
  * Action: ensure any origin firewall/CDN rules allow Netlify and ostr.io traffic.


## Disable Pre-rendering integration

Open new Netlify Support ticket requesting removal of the ostr.io pre-rendering integration for the site (list site(s)).


## FAQ

* **Is this automatic?**
  * No. Netlify must enable the integration after receiving the `Basic ...` Auth Token.

* **How long does enablement take?**
  * Netlify typically completes enablement within **24 hours** of receiving the request.

* **Which requests are pre-rendered?**
  * Crawler traffic (search engines and modern AI crawlers/agents). Regular visitor traffic is unaffected.

* **Does this impact Core Web Vitals?**
  * Yes, it improves Web Vitals Scores for crawlers and bots with positive impact on crawler index, SEO scores, and organic traffic. Visitor-side Core Web Vitals remain unaffected by the crawler integration.


## Support

* **ostr.io support:** account, token, and pre-rendering configuration questions.
* **Netlify Support:** enable/disable the integration for specific sites and apply/update the Auth Token.

If additional details are needed for enterprise scenarios (multi-site enablement, staged rollouts, or custom crawler policies), contact ostr.io support with the target domains and desired policy.
