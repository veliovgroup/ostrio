### Individual page cache purge:
While full cache purging is limited by time-frame. The individually cached page can be purged anytime without limits. To purge single page from cache "Cache ID" has to be obtained in response headers as `X-Prerender-Id`.

#### Purge aggressively cached pages or AppCache
The reason why you may not found x-prerender-id header in DevTools is aggressive caching or usage of AppCache, to avoid this issue please follow next steps (in Chrome or Opera):
 1. Open new Private window
 2. Open URL with appended ?_escaped_fragment_=
 3. Open "Developer Tools"
 4. In "Developer Tools" go to "Network" tab
 5. Check "Disable Cache" checkbox
 6. Reload/Refresh page
 7. In "Network" tab select "/?_escaped_fragment_=" document (should be the first)
 8. In opened area make sure "Header" tab is selected
 9. In "Response Headers" section find "x-prerender-id" header
 
### Notes:
While cache is purged from Prerendering engine it may remain cached for up to 2 hours on intermediate proxy servers.
