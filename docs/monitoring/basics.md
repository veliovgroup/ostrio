- [Availability Monitoring](https://github.com/veliovgroup/ostrio/blob/master/docs/monitoring/basics.md#availability-httphttps-monitoring)
- [Custom Data Monitoring](https://github.com/veliovgroup/ostrio/blob/master/docs/monitoring/basics.md#custom-data-monitoring)
- [SNMP (Health) Monitoring](https://github.com/veliovgroup/ostrio/blob/master/docs/monitoring/basics.md#snmp-monitoring)

## Availability HTTP/HTTPS Monitoring

This is the most basic type of monitoring. Only most basic data is collected and analyzed - "Response Time", "Status Code", "Uptime".

{
  "active": 98,
  "reading": 0,
  "writing": 55,
  "waiting":43
}
```

### As XML:

```xml
<data>
  <active>98</active>
  <reading>0</reading>
  <writing>55</writing>
  <waiting>43</waiting>
