# Monitoring

__No installation is required, 100% SaaS solution.__ Be the first to know when a website or a server is down. Receive email and instant SMS warnings for bad response code, delayed response time, mime-type and content substitution, SSH logins, and server resources consumption.

`http` and `https` protocols can be used for availability checks, perfect for API endpoints, websites, and web servers. Although it doesn't require any setup for simple availability monitoring it can be easily extended. If an endpoint returns a response with plain one-level `XML` or `JSON` - it will be parsed with the ability to set notification triggers.

`SNMP` protocol more complex and requires additional setup on the server side. It is the industry standard for hardware monitoring. With SNMP we can collect data, monitor and warn about CPU and RAM utilization, storage space, network load, SSH sessions, server reboots, and other critical data.
