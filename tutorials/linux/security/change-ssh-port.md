# Change default SSH port

The best practice of the "*best practices*" ðŸ˜… is to change default SSH port. As the Internet full of automated scanners and bots â€” most vulnerable are widely used default applications and ports.

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file, â€” find and update value of the line staring with `Port` as a new value for port pick a number between `1024` and `65535`:

```shell
# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Find line starting with "Port":
Port 64537 # CHANGE TO PORT OF YOUR CHOICE 1024-65535

# Save file with: "ctrl + o" combination
# Close file with: "ctrl + x" combination
```

Restart SSH service:

```shell
service sshd restart
```

To connect again via SSH explicitly set port via `-p` flag:

```shell
ssh -p 64537 username@host
```
