# Create new system user

## Why create another system users in Linux?

- Web-applications should run under its own users, to isolate system files in case of the breach
- Databases should run under its own user
- SSH login should be allowed to the user with limited permissions on the server and disabled for `root` user
- Other security and usage reasons

## Two common Linux users types:

- With login permissions (password and home folder are not set)
- Without login permissions (*services and applications*)

__NOTE:__ change `[username]` to actual users' name

### Password-less user

Let's start with login-less (*or password-less*) users (most secure, best for running isolated web-apps):

```shell
useradd [username]

# that's it
```

To allow login as `user` without password, just set new password for such user:

```shell
passwd [username]

# this command will ask
# to prompt new password twice
```

To add a home folder for such limited user, run:

```shell
# Create folder
mkdir -p /home/[username]
# Set home folder
usermod -m -d /home/[username] [username]
```

### Full-featured user

Fully capable user (with password, home folder and SSH access) can be created with single command:

```shell
adduser [username]

# this command will ask
# to fill additional info about user
# it can be safely skipped with hitting ENTER
# But do not skip password, and prompt it twice
# Finally, to confirm provided info - press "Y"
```
