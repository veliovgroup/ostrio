# Pinterest Rich Pins basics

## About:

__Description by Pinterest:__
> Rich Pins show metadata right on the Pin itself, giving Pinners a richer experience and increasing engagement. Information in a Rich Pin is independent of the Pin description, ensuring that important information is always tied to the Pin. There are 4 types of Rich Pins: app, article, product and recipe Pins.
>
> Rich Pins work by displaying metadata from marked up pages on your website. Once you've applied for Rich Pins, any content on your site with metadata will turn into a Rich Pin when a user saves it.

Needs to be mentioned: ["Structured Data"](https://github.com/veliovgroup/ostrio/blob/master/tutorials/website/social-networking/structured-data-basics.md) and [Open Graph](https://github.com/veliovgroup/ostrio/blob/master/tutorials/website/social-networking/open-graph-basics.md) is supported by Pinterest too, basically Pinterest Rich Pins is based on combination of Open Graph and "Structured Data" with some extra tags extension `article:`.

## Basic structure:

This example is very basic usage, but will cover most of the cases. For more info and examples - *see links below*.
